==Introduction==

MRTG Dashboard is a self contained PHP script which turns your directory of MRTG graphs into a pretty dashboard.

It is still in development, but otherwise fully working.

==Installation==

Simply place index.php inside your MRTG directory on your PHP-enabled web server. That's it. Assumes all your MRTG output files are in one directory and you don't have anything fancier set up.

==Todo==

# Add option to switch to longer-timescale graphs.
# Ensure it works acceptably on mobile devices.
# Perhaps use Highcharts to render the data directly.
