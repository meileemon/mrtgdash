==Introduction==

MRTG Dashboard is a self contained PHP script which turns your directory of MRTG graphs into a pretty dashboard.

It is still in development, but otherwise fully working.

==Installation==

Simply place index.php inside your MRTG directory on your PHP-enabled web server. That's it.

==Todo==

# Add option to switch to longer-timescale graphs
