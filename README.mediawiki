==Introduction==

MRTG Dashboard is a self contained PHP script which turns your directory of MRTG graphs into a pretty dashboard. It also uses your MRTG data to produce some more modern and useful graphs if you're bored with squinting at blocky image graphs.

==Requirements==

# MRTG, configured and running, saving files into a single directory (workdir).
# PHP enabled web server.
# Your browser requires general Internet access as CDNs are used to load CSS and Javascript libraries.

==Installation==

Simply place index.php inside your MRTG directory on your web server. That's it.
